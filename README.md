# Sentiment Analysis Ruleex ANN-DT
Implementation of Ruleex ANN-DT for sentiment analysis for English Language. The dataset used is Large Movie Review Dataset (Imdb reviews) which have total of 50K reviews having equal distribution in training and test dataset (25K each). Furthermore, the distribution of positive and negative reviews in training and test dataset is also equal (12.5K pos and 12.5 neg reviews in each training and test dataset). Here we take the reduced data for demonstration since the alogorithm is very slow. The model in use is simple deep neural network with tf-idf featurs.
